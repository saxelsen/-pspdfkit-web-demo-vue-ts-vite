# Vue3 + Typescript + PSPDFKit + Vite demo

## Getting started

Requirements:
- `node>=16`
- `yarn` or `npm`

I've used `npm`, but it works just as well with `yarn`.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the app in development mode: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to your browser at `localhost:8080`
